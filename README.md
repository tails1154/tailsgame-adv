# tailsgame-adv

Just a game i made in class with chatgpt

## Why I uploaded this

so I don't lose it lol


## How do I run this?

Well first, don't use the Makefile. It was designed just for my environment that I made the program in.

anyways... First you need python and pip. you can get both from your distro's package manager (hopefully)

then create a venv (if you want) or try to use pip. If you want to attempt to install the libs globally, then use your distros package manager (get the message from pip that tells you about the externally managed environment and what package manager to install) to install the pygame python lib

finally, run python3 game.py
